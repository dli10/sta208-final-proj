# sta208-final-proj

This repository contains the code for STA208 final project, exploring the use of SVM (support vector machine) on the Fashion-MNIST dataset for image classification.

The Fashion-MNIST dataset can be found on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zalando-research/fashionmnist

final_project_svm.ipynb trains SVM on this dataset using different feature extraction methods: PCA, FastICA, and TruncatedSVD. The dataset was also trained with logistic regression as an additional comparison.
